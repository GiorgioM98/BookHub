## Introduction

The project consists of creating of a webpage that allows the user to search a new book to read by genre.


## Structure


The structure of the project is:

index.html: contains the backbone structure of the project.

styles.css: the style sheet with which I created the style and graphics.

index.js: script used to create the various HTML dynamic elements and the various functionality (add event listner, alert button...).


## Tecnologies used


I used several technologies to create BookHub:

Visual Studio Code, as editor for writing the code.
Pinterest for obtaining the image.
HTML, to crate the container for the immage.
CSS played a crucial role in providing the project with an aesthetic appearance.
Bootstrap for responsive design and also for aestethic appearance.

Finally, JavaScript, the programming language of choice, was used to implement the functionality with APIs of https://openlibrary.org/.
There are a two type of APIs, api that allow us to search a book by genre and api that allow us to have the key of description.

## Usability


There are available an input box, where you must write a genre, and a search button, very simple.
After you have pressed the button, you must scroll down and choose which will be your next book.
You can see some cards with cover images, a title, the author(s) and a button that show a brief description of each book.
